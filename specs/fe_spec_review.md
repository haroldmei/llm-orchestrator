# Feature Engineering Review (BiLSTM)

## Summary Assessment

This is a well-structured feature specification for NFL player movement prediction using BiLSTM models. The specification demonstrates strong understanding of temporal modeling requirements with excellent leakage prevention measures. The sequence policy is comprehensive with proper masking, padding, and variable-length handling. The feature engineering approach covers essential movement dynamics through position, velocity, acceleration, and relative positioning features.

Key strengths include thorough temporal correctness validation, appropriate cyclical encoding for angular features, and a sensible time-based validation strategy. The dimensionality calculations are clear and the memory estimates are helpful for production planning.

Areas needing attention include verification of field dependencies (absolute_yardline_number), clarification of mixed normalization implementation, and some edge case handling in geometric calculations.

## Detailed Review by Section

### Data Contract & Schema
- **FEATURE_SPEC#data_contract** Missing absolute_yardline_number field referenced in field_x_normalized feature → Add to schema or remove dependent feature (MAJOR)
- **FEATURE_SPEC#data_contract** Schema properly covers all base tracking fields with correct dtypes and units (STRENGTH)

### Sequence Policy  
- **FEATURE_SPEC#sequence_policy** Excellent BiLSTM-optimized configuration with T=50, proper masking, left-padding strategy (STRENGTH)
- **FEATURE_SPEC#sequence_policy.bucketing** Small bucket ranges may reduce training efficiency → Consider consolidating to [1-15], [16-30], [31-45], [46-50] (MINOR)

### Feature Engineering
- **FEATURE_SPEC#feature_table** Comprehensive coverage of movement dynamics with proper temporal derivatives (STRENGTH)  
- **FEATURE_SPEC#feature_table.ball_angle** Potential atan2 edge case when player exactly at ball position → Add epsilon handling (MINOR)
- **FEATURE_SPEC#feature_table** Excellent cyclical encoding for orientation/direction features (STRENGTH)

### Normalization Strategy
- **FEATURE_SPEC#normalization** Mixed StandardScaler/RobustScaler approach needs clearer implementation details → Specify exact feature group assignments (MINOR)
- **FEATURE_SPEC#normalization.scope** Proper global fit on training data only prevents leakage (STRENGTH)

### Temporal Validity
- **FEATURE_SPEC#leakage_analysis** Thorough analysis with clear t <= pass_release_time constraint enforcement (STRENGTH)
- **FEATURE_SPEC#validation_policy** Time-based weekly splits properly prevent temporal leakage (STRENGTH)

## Strengths
- Rigorous temporal leakage prevention with comprehensive analysis
- BiLSTM-optimized sequence handling with proper masking and variable lengths  
- Thoughtful feature engineering covering movement dynamics and spatial relationships
- Clear dimensionality calculations and implementation guidance
- Proper handling of cyclical features and categorical embeddings
- Well-designed validation strategy using temporal splits

## Areas for Improvement
- Verify all referenced schema fields exist in actual dataset
- Clarify mixed normalization implementation approach
- Add robust edge case handling for geometric calculations
- Optimize bucketing strategy for training efficiency
- Confirm test-time availability of contextual fields

## Production Readiness
- **CONFIDENCE_SCORE: 86%**
- **Verdict: Needs Fixes ❌**

The specification is strong but requires resolution of the schema dependency issue and clarification of implementation details before production deployment. The core temporal modeling approach is sound and the feature engineering is comprehensive.
