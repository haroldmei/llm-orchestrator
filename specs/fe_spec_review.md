# Feature Engineering Review (BiLSTM)

## Summary Assessment
This feature specification demonstrates strong technical competence with well-designed BiLSTM-appropriate features and sequence processing. The specification shows good understanding of NFL tracking data and includes thoughtful feature engineering with positional, temporal, and contextual elements. However, several critical issues prevent production readiness, particularly around temporal leakage validation, dimensionality consistency, and missing validation frameworks.

## Detailed Review by Section

**Sequence Processing ✓**
- Variable-length sequences (5-25 frames) with max length 30 are appropriate for BiLSTM
- Pre-padding with mask_value=-999 preserves temporal causality
- Stride=1 provides good temporal resolution for tracking data

**Feature Engineering ⚠️**
- [Derived Features] Rolling window calculations lack explicit causal constraints → Implement backward-only rolling windows with min_periods=1 (BLOCKER)
- [Final Dimensionality] Calculation error: claims 41 total but actual sum is 43+ → Recalculate all feature dimensions systematically (MAJOR)
- [Angular Features] Direction change 360° wrapping needs implementation details → Specify circular difference calculation (MINOR)

**Normalization Strategy ✓**
- Global scaling for positions/speeds maintains field-relative scaling
- Per-sequence scaling for derivatives captures play-specific dynamics
- Appropriate scaler choices (standard vs robust) based on feature characteristics

**Temporal Validity ❌**
- [Data Quality] Missing explicit temporal cutoff validation → Add frame_id-based leakage detection (MAJOR)
- [Rolling Features] Potential future information leakage in window operations → Implement strict causal validation (BLOCKER)
- [Split Strategy] Lacks detailed time-aware validation specification → Define temporal cross-validation approach (MAJOR)

## Strengths
- Comprehensive feature set covering spatial relationships, temporal dynamics, and player context
- Proper cyclical encoding for angular features using sin/cos transforms
- Well-designed embedding dimensions following established heuristics
- Thoughtful imputation strategies (ffill for temporal, mode/mean for attributes)
- Clear feature intent classification (signal/context/control)
- Appropriate BiLSTM tensor structure with proper masking support

## Areas for Improvement
- **Temporal Causality**: Strengthen validation to ensure no future information leaks into features
- **Validation Framework**: Add comprehensive time-aware cross-validation and evaluation strategy
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Fix dimensionality calculations and provide clear feature shape specifications
- **Edge Case Handling**: Specify OOV strategies for embeddings and rare category management
- **Implementation Details**: Add specific algorithms for angular calculations and boundary conditions

## Production Readiness
- **CONFIDENCE_SCORE: 70%**
- **Verdict: Needs Fixes ❌**

The specification shows strong foundational work but requires addressing temporal leakage risks and validation gaps before production deployment. With the recommended fixes, this could become a solid BiLSTM feature pipeline for NFL player movement prediction.
