# Feature Engineering Review (BiLSTM)

## Summary Assessment
The specification demonstrates strong technical execution in feature engineering but suffers from critical architectural flaws in temporal alignment and sequence definition. The core issue is the disconnect between pre-pass input sequences and post-pass prediction targets, compounded by the use of ball landing coordinates that create temporal leakage. While the feature transformations and encoding strategies are well-designed, the sequence policy lacks empirical validation and the masking strategy needs refinement.

## Detailed Review by Section
- [sequence_params] Window size T=20 may not match actual pre-pass durations → Analyze sequence length distribution and align T with empirical data (BLOCKER)
- [features#ball_land_derived] Uses ball landing coordinates only known post-completion → Remove or replace with QB-based proxies (BLOCKER)
- [features#delta_features] NaN creation in first frame → Implement lag-aware imputation (MAJOR)
- [sequence_params#padding] Mask value ambiguity → Use explicit sentinel value and preserve in normalization (MAJOR)
- [features#player_age] Missing play_date data → Confirm availability or use season proxy (MAJOR)
- [features#normalization_scopes] Mixed normalization strategies → Document rationale and consider position-aware scaling (MINOR)
- [features#embeddings] Potentially excessive embedding dimensions → Optimize based on position cardinality (MINOR)

## Strengths
- Comprehensive motion dynamics captured through well-designed derived features
- Appropriate scaling methods matched to feature distributions (robust for accelerations, minmax for angles)
- Clear feature categorization and transformation pipelines
- Good handling of temporal aspects with frame-based tracking
- Thoughtful outlier policies using quantile clipping

## Areas for Improvement
- Critical need for temporal alignment analysis between input sequences and prediction targets
- Validation of feature availability at prediction time (especially ball landing data)
- Empirical optimization of sequence windowing parameters
- Enhanced masking strategy for variable-length sequences
- Game/play-aware cross-validation methodology

## Production Readiness
- CONFIDENCE_SCORE: 68%
- Verdict: Needs Fixes ❌

**Critical blockers must be addressed:**
1. Resolve temporal leakage from ball landing coordinates
2. Define proper sequence alignment with pass release time (t0)
3. Implement robust masking for variable-length sequences
4. Validate all feature availability at prediction time
