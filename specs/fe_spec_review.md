# Feature Engineering Review (BiLSTM)

## Summary Assessment
The specification demonstrates strong technical foundations but has critical blockers in temporal alignment and information leakage. The use of ball landing coordinates represents future information not available at prediction time. Sequence construction needs clearer alignment with the multi-frame prediction task.

## Detailed Review by Section
- [sequence_params#window_size] Window size may be insufficient for pre-pass context → Analyze typical pre-pass duration and adjust window size (BLOCKER)
- [features#ball_land_x] Uses future ball landing information → Remove or use as training-only auxiliary (BLOCKER)
- [sequence_params#alignment] No explicit input-output alignment → Define clear mapping between input sequences and prediction frames (MAJOR)
- [features#derived] Velocity calculations need boundary handling → Implement special handling for sequence starts (MAJOR)
- [features#player_to_predict] Missing prediction flag feature → Add player_to_predict as binary indicator (MAJOR)
- [sequence_params#validation] No temporal validation strategy → Implement time-based or grouped cross-validation (MINOR)
- [features#cyclic] Robust scaling breaks circularity → Use sin/cos encoding for angles (MINOR)

## Strengths
- Comprehensive feature engineering covering both raw tracking data and meaningful derived features
- Well-documented transformation pipelines with clear data provenance
- Appropriate data type handling and normalization strategies
- Good consideration of online deployment constraints and latency requirements
- Robust outlier handling with quantile-based clipping

## Areas for Improvement
- Critical need to address temporal information leakage from ball landing coordinates
- Clearer definition of sequence construction and alignment with multi-frame predictions
- Improved handling of cyclic variables using proper circular encoding
- Better edge case management for sequence boundaries in derived features
- Explicit validation strategy for temporal data splitting

## Production Readiness
- CONFIDENCE_SCORE: 68%
- Verdict: Needs Fixes ❌

**Critical Path to Production:**
1. Remove ball_land_x/y features or restrict to training context only
2. Define explicit sequence-to-prediction alignment policy
3. Implement proper temporal validation splits
4. Address cyclic variable encoding and sequence boundary handling
