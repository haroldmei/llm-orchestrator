# Feature Engineering Review (BiLSTM)

## Summary Assessment
The feature specification demonstrates strong technical execution with comprehensive coverage of player tracking data and appropriate BiLSTM sequence parameters. However, critical data leakage issues related to ball landing coordinates fundamentally undermine the temporal validity of the approach. The specification requires significant rework to eliminate future information before it can be considered production-ready.

## Detailed Review by Section
- [FEATURE_SPEC#ball_land_features] Uses ball landing coordinates which represent future information not available at prediction time → Remove all features derived from ball landing coordinates (BLOCKER)
- [FEATURE_SPEC#sequence_params] Window alignment to outcome time t0 not clearly defined → Align sequences to end at ball release frame with variable length sequences (MAJOR)
- [FEATURE_SPEC#derived_features] Multiple features depend on leaked ball landing information → Replace with pre-pass relative positioning features (MAJOR)
- [FEATURE_SPEC#player_position] No OOV strategy for categorical embeddings → Add OOV bucket and consider position grouping (MINOR)
- [FEATURE_SPEC#sequence_params] No temporal split strategy specified → Implement time-based splits by game week (MINOR)

## Strengths
- Comprehensive coverage of player motion and positional data
- Appropriate cyclical encoding for directional features (orientation, direction)
- Well-documented normalization strategies with proper train-only fitting
- Clear BiLSTM sequence parameters with padding and masking support
- Good mix of raw signals and meaningful derived temporal features

## Areas for Improvement
- Critical need to eliminate all features dependent on ball landing coordinates
- Better definition of temporal alignment between input sequences and prediction targets
- Specification of OOV handling for categorical variables
- Implementation of time-aware data splitting strategy
- Feature importance analysis to justify the current dimensionality

## Production Readiness
- CONFIDENCE_SCORE: 75%
- Verdict: Needs Fixes ❌

**Critical Path to Production:**
1. Immediately remove all ball landing coordinate features and their derivatives
2. Redesign features using only information available at ball release
3. Implement proper temporal alignment and splitting
4. Retest for leakage and temporal validity
